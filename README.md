## How It Works
WebSockets vs. APIs
WebSockets: Provide two-way communication between the client and server, allowing real-time data exchange. Ideal for chat applications where instant updates are essential.
APIs (HTTP/REST): Utilize HTTP requests and responses for communication. Suitable for non-real-time interactions but involves overhead with each request and response cycle.
Architecture
Frontend: The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, offering a responsive and visually appealing design.
Backend: Node.js and Express handle the server-side logic. Socket.io manages real-time communication between users, ensuring messages are delivered instantly and chat history is maintained.
Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Ensure Node.js is Installed:

If Node.js is not installed on your system, download and install it from nodejs.org. Follow the instructions for your operating system.

For Windows: Download the installer and follow the installation prompts.
For macOS: Use the installer or install via Homebrew with brew install node.
For Linux: Use your package manager to install Node.js (e.g., sudo apt install nodejs for Ubuntu).
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-application.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd chat-application
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Server:

bash
Copy code
npm run serve
Open Your Browser:

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to start using the chat application.

Usage
Once the server is running, you can open multiple browser tabs or windows to test real-time messaging. Each tab will represent a different user, and you can see messages being exchanged instantly.
