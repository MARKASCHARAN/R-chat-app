How It Works
WebSockets vs. APIs
WebSockets: Provide two-way communication between the client and server, allowing real-time data exchange. Ideal for chat applications where instant updates are essential.
APIs (HTTP/REST): Utilize HTTP requests and responses for communication. Suitable for non-real-time interactions but involves overhead with each request and response cycle.
Architecture
Frontend: The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, offering a responsive and visually appealing design.
Backend: Node.js and Express handle the server-side logic. Socket.io manages real-time communication between users, ensuring messages are delivered instantly and chat history is maintained.
